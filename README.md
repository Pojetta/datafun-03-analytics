# Task 1: Start a New Project (Recommended Workflow)

Use the recommended workflow for starting a new project — it's reliable and most likely to work with the fewest issues. Follow these steps to get familiar with the workflow to begin a real-world project in GitHub. Then, work through the detailed instructions and commands provided in the Module 8 page named _Workflow: Start a New Project_.

### Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   In your browser, create a GitHub project repository with a default `README.md`. Name your repo `datafun-03-analytics`.

2. **Clone Your Repository Locally**  
   Clone your new repository down to your machine into your `Documents` folder.

3. **Open in VS Code**  
   Open your new project repository folder in the `Documents` folder of your machine using VS Code (if you haven't already).

4. **Add a `.gitignore` File**  
   In VS Code, add a useful `.gitignore` file. Include lines for `.vscode/`, `.venv/`, and any other files or folders that don't need to be tracked in the repository.

5. **Edit Your `README.md`**  
   In VS Code, edit your `README.md` file to record your commands, process, and notes so far.

6. **Open Terminal in VS Code**  
   Open a terminal in VS Code — use zsh/bash if you're on Mac/Linux.

7. **Add, Commit, and Push**  
   Use the terminal to add your files to source control with `git add .`, commit your changes with `git commit -m "initial commit"`, and push your changes to GitHub with `git push origin main`.

8. **Verify**  
   Go to GitHub and verify that your repository has been updated.

### Reminder:

With this workflow, you can be sure your code is safe in the cloud. If needed, you can delete your local folder, or even if your machine crashes, your project work is safe on GitHub. You can always clone it again to start from scratch on a new machine. Otherwise, use `git pull -u origin main` to ensure you have the most current changes.
